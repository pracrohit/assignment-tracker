//  Task: Movie Search App
//
//  Create a simple movie search app that allows users to search for movies and view their details. The app should meet the following requirements:
//
//  1. Use an API (such as OMDB) to fetch movie data.
//  2. Allow the user to search for movies by title.
//  3. Display a list of search results with the movie title, year, and poster image.
//  4. Allow the user to tap on a movie to view more details, such as the plot, director, cast, rating, and runtime.
//  5. Use Swift's Codable protocol to parse the JSON data returned by the API.
//  6. Implement error handling to handle any possible errors while fetching or parsing data.
//  7. Implement basic UI design and layout using Auto Layout constraints.
